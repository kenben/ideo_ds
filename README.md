# IDEO Data Take-Home
The IDEO data challenge take-home.

## Notebooks
Both the warm-up and challenge exercises can be seen in HTML-exported Jupyter notebooks:
1. [Warmup Exercise](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kenben/ideo_ds/gh-pages/html/warmup_exercise.html)
2. [Challenge Exercise](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kenben/ideo_ds/master/html/challenge_exercise.html)

Note that the challenge exercise notebook contains interactive maps (created with [Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium)), and these will require an internet connection to display.

## Code
If you'd like to see or execute any of the code, visit the [repo's master branch](https://github.com/kenben/ideo_ds) for details.
