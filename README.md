# IDEO Take-Home

All analyses and write-ups are contained in the Jupyter Notebooks in [`notebooks/`](https://github.com/kenben/ideo_ds/tree/master/notebooks). Simply browse through them there.

## Setup
If you would like to re-run any of the code, you will need Python 3.5 and several open-source packages. If you use `virtualenv`, you can easily create the necessary environment (assuming you are in the repo's main directory) as follows:
1. `virtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python3.5 env`
2. `source env/bin/activate`
3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Data
Note that some of the notebooks read and write data to/from the [`data/`](https://github.com/kenben/ideo_ds/tree/master/data) folder.
